Notes:
- [x] Where the hell is modulo
- [ ] Fixtures and test parametrization
- [ ] Formatting config

Remarks
- Never have I made so many 1-off errors in any language ever, considering I have spent a good bit of time in C and Java it's disappointing
- Compiler is a delight
- Hard to set-up decent dev tooling
- Need to read up on borrow-checking
- ML parts and Algebraic Types are lovely

> Overall it's 5/7 experience.
